> Part of [Trax](https://github.com/TraxSharp): business logic you can call, schedule, or serve as an API, with every

`Trax.Cli` is the `trax` .NET tool. `trax generate` scaffolds a hub and a library of Trax trains from an OpenAPI or
GraphQL schema, and `trax machine` generates state-machine code. The hub comes from the `trax-hub` template in
[Trax.Samples](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples); the trains are typed pipelines of small steps (junctions)
whose bodies you fill in.

## Install

```bash
dotnet new install Trax.Samples.Templates   # trax generate builds on the trax-hub template
dotnet tool install --global Trax.Cli       # needs the .NET 10 SDK
```

## Example

```bash
trax generate --schema ./schema.graphql --output ./Payments --name Payments
cd Payments/Payments.Hub && dotnet run

trax machine new checkout --output ./Machines --namespace MyApp.Machines
```

`generate` reads GraphQL SDL or an OpenAPI 3.0 document and writes a hub plus one train per operation, each junction
throwing `NotImplementedException` under a `TODO` for you to fill in. `trax <command> --help` lists every option.

## Where this fits

Trax is split into layers, one repo each. Take the ones you need; the trains you wrote do not change. **You are here: Trax.Cli.**

| Repo | What it adds |
|---|---|
| [Trax.Core](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Core) | Trains, junctions and the chain, with no database and no DI container |
| [Trax.Effect](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Effect) | A recorded run for every execution (Postgres, SQLite or in memory), DI, effect providers, the state-machine engine |
| [Trax.Mediator](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Mediator) | The train bus: run a train by handing over its input, with every chain checked at startup |
| [Trax.Scheduler](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Scheduler) | Cron and interval schedules, retries, dead letters, and workers on other machines or in Lambda |
| [Trax.Api](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Api) | GraphQL generated from your trains, with authentication, audit and typed clients |
| [Trax.Dashboard](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Dashboard) | A Blazor Server UI for runs, schedules and dead letters, mounted in your app |
| **[Trax.Cli](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Cli)** | **The `trax` tool: scaffold a hub and trains from an OpenAPI or GraphQL schema, and state-machine codegen** |
| [Trax.Samples](https://github.com/TraxSharp/Trax.Samples) | Complete sample apps, and the `trax-api`, `trax-scheduler` and `trax-hub` templates |
